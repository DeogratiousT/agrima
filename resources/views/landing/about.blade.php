				<h4 class="orange-text mt-4"><span>OUR STORY</span></h4>
				75% of Kenya’s population are directly involved in agribusiness for their survival and many depend on it as a single source of earning. <br>
				The Kenyan food processing industry accounts for 32% of the country’s total food market, making it one of the largest growing sectors in Kenya  and is ranked first in terms of production, consumption, export, and expected growth. <br>
				Despite this, largely it is seen to be unorganized in the way business is conducted. There is overdependence on physical markets for the conduct of large business transactions and is plagued with complaints of exploitation of poor and marginal farmers who often feel cheated of a fair price for their produce. Often, they not even recover their input costs, resulting in their losing faith in the prevalent system.
